<div style="text-align: justify">

I am a PhD candidate in Computational and Synthetic Biology. I currently work on directed evolution with *Bacillus subtilis*, a sympathetic [Gram-positive bacterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria) with an emphasis on computational modelling of directed evolution. Therefore, I share my time between biology at the bench - "wet-lab" - and bioinformatics - "dry-lab". 

I also have an interest in science communication and journalism, and I am always eager to find ways contribute to science popularization.

During the academic year 2019-2020, I had the chance to work for the communication service of Paris-Saclay University, as a side dish to my doctoral work, under the supervision of Véronique Meder. I prepared and conducted all interviews, selected the quotes to be used, and wrote the articles.

NB : I wrote the articles in French and they were later translated by someone else.

In [l'Édition de l'Université Paris-Saclay #14](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/sites/default/files/2020-10/UPS_EDITION%2314_VF_WEB.pdf) (print edition) : two short articles, "Come the night, toll the hour: time running out in confinement", "A maximum-security laboratory for studying  pathogenic organisms in the Saclay area", and "Covid-19: Université Paris-Saclay – a project hub".
